# ENCRYPTION-DECRYPTION

Welcome to the Encryption and Decryption Projects! This repository hosts three fascinating projects that showcase the power of encryption and decryption techniques in securing information. Each project employs different methods to safeguard data, ranging from classic ciphers to steganography.

Project 1: Caesar Cipher
Description: This project offers a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text using the Caesar cipher. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each character in the plaintext by a fixed key. Users can input their text and specify the encryption key, and the application will generate the corresponding ciphertext. Decryption is accomplished by providing the ciphertext and the correct key.

Project 2: Encoder and Decoder
Description: In this project, we combine the Vigenere cipher and steganography to enable both text and image encryption and decryption. The Vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, providing enhanced security compared to simpler ciphers. Users can input their text and a secret keyword for encryption, and the application will generate the ciphertext. Moreover, the project allows users to hide encrypted text within images using steganography, making it appear unchanged to observers. Decryption is achieved by providing the appropriate keyword and the ciphertext, or by extracting the hidden text from the encrypted image.

Project 3: Vigenere Cipher
Description: This project focuses solely on text encryption and decryption using the Vigenere cipher. Users can input their text and a secret keyword for encryption, and the application will produce the ciphertext. Decryption requires the same keyword and ciphertext to retrieve the original text.
